/**
 * Usage :JSONBase a generic class which can be subclassed and add properties to read from the dictionary.
 *        When subclassed create dynamic properties.
 * Current State of development : Currently this class maps with dictionary with same keyname in dictionary as name of property in model
 *                                class.
 * Letter Enhancement : But to make more useful we can have keymapper which can map keys of dictionary with name of property in model class.
